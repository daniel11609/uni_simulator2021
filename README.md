Uni simulator 2021 is a university project within the scope of the Software Engineering I course at the DHBW Ravensburg at the Friedrichshafen campus.

The goal of the project is to create a game that combines the two aspects of a clicker game with a simulation of everyday university life.
Accordingly, Uni-Simulator 2021 is a browser game from the Idle - genre, which is completely stored on the user devices and only runs locally.

The technologies used mainly include: 
HTML, JavaScript, React.js, Photoshop
